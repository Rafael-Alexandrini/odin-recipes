      <li>Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
      <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
      <li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
